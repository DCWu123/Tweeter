# Tweeter
Create a tweeter bot that grabs @Oviscori_UNA tweets about earthquakes and plots them in a Costa Rica map.
Using a Tweeter Developer account and its API we managed to use information provided in real time by @Oviscori_UNA  tweeter account about every earthquake that Costa Rica is having.
With that information we manage to purify it and mold it so that with the use of pandas we can plot it on a map showing finally in real time where is the earthquake in Costa Rica.
For this project we used Pyrhon3 as our main programming languaje and various libraries within it sucj=h as:
- NUMPY
- MATPLOTLIB
- FOLLIUM
- PANDAS
- SEABORN 
- RE
